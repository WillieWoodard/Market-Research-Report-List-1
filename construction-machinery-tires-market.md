<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Machinery Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Construction machinery tires can be categorized into two types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with the cords running perpendicular to the direction of travel, which increases stability and provides better fuel efficiency. They have a flexible sidewall that enables smoother rides and longer tread life. On the other hand, bias tires are built using plies that overlap at angles, offering enhanced durability and resistance to punctures. They provide strong traction and are often preferred for off-road applications. Both types have their own advantages and suitable applications in the construction machinery industry.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Construction Machinery Tires Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aftermarkets</li><li>OEMs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>In the construction machinery tires market, there are two main segments: aftermarkets and OEMs. Aftermarkets refer to the sales of tires after the initial purchase of the machinery. These tires are usually purchased when the original tires wear out or get damaged. On the other hand, OEMs refer to the original equipment manufacturers who provide tires as a part of their machinery sales. They directly supply tires to construction machinery manufacturers for new equipment. Both aftermarket and OEMs play crucial roles in fulfilling the tire needs of the construction machinery industry.</p></p>

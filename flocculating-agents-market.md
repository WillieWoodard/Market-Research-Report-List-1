<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flocculating Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Type</li><li>Organic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flocculating agents, also known as flocculants, are substances used in industrial processes to promote the aggregation of fine particles into larger clumps or flocs. Inorganic flocculating agents are typically metallic salts, such as aluminum sulfate or ferric chloride, which work by neutralizing the electrical charges on particles and causing them to come together. Organic flocculating agents, on the other hand, are synthetic polymers or natural substances like starch or cellulose, which work by physically bridging the particles or adsorbing onto their surfaces to facilitate floc formation. The choice between inorganic and organic flocculants depends on the specific application and desired results.</p></p>

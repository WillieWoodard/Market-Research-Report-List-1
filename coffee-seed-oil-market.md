<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coffee Seed Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Pressed Oils</li><li>CO2/Solvent Extraction Oils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The coffee seed oil market encompasses two major types: cold-pressed oils and CO2/solvent extraction oils. Cold-pressed oils are obtained by mechanically pressing the coffee seeds, using minimal heat to preserve the oil's natural properties. This process ensures a high-quality oil with a rich aroma and robust flavor. On the other hand, CO2/solvent extraction oils involve using carbon dioxide or solvents to extract oil from the coffee seeds. This method may yield greater quantities of oil, but it can result in a loss of some natural flavors and aromas.</p></p>

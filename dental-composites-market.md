<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Composites Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct</li><li>Indirect</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental composites market comprises direct and indirect types. Direct composites are applied directly to the tooth structure, providing restorations in a single dental visit without the need for laboratory fabrication. These composites are commonly used for small to medium-sized cavities. On the other hand, indirect composites are created outside the mouth, typically in a dental laboratory. They are used for larger restorations and require multiple dental visits for fabrication and placement. Both types of composites offer aesthetic appeal, improved strength, and durability for dental restorations.</p></p>

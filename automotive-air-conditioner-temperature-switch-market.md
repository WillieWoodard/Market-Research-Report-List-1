<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Air Conditioner Temperature Switch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bimetallic Strip Switch</li><li>Liquid Filled Temperature Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive air conditioner temperature switch market is divided into two types - bimetallic strip switch and liquid-filled temperature switch. The bimetallic strip switch uses two different metal strips that expand or contract at different rates when exposed to temperature changes. This movement activates the switch, regulating the temperature. On the other hand, the liquid-filled temperature switch contains a temperature-responsive liquid that expands or contracts depending on the temperature. This movement triggers the switch, controlling the air conditioner's temperature output in vehicles. Both types function to ensure proper temperature regulation in automotive air conditioning systems.</p></p>

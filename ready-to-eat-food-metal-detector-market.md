<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ready to Eat Food Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Frequency</li><li>High Frequency</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ready to Eat Food Metal Detector market offers two main types of detectors: Low Frequency and High Frequency. Low Frequency detectors are designed to scan for larger metal objects in the food, such as metal parts or tools, by emitting electromagnetic waves with a slow oscillation. On the other hand, High Frequency detectors are more sensitive and can identify smaller metal contaminants like metal filings or fragments. They operate by using shorter wavelength electromagnetic waves that oscillate at a higher frequency. Both types aim to ensure the safety of ready-to-eat food products by identifying and removing any metal contaminants during production and packaging processes.</p></p>

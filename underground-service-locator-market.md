<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underground Service Locator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Location</li><li>Passive Location</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Underground Service Locator market encompasses two types: Active Location and Passive Location. Active Location refers to the use of a transmitter that emits signals, which are then picked up by a receiver above ground to locate underground utilities or objects. This method requires the user to actively search for the signal. On the other hand, Passive Location involves detecting natural electromagnetic fields emitted by objects underground without the need for a transmitter. It allows for more convenient and efficient identification of underground services without requiring active signal transmission.</p></p>

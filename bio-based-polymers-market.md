<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-based Polymers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bio-Degradable</li><li>Non-Degradable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Bio-based polymers are a type of polymers derived from renewable resources such as plants, animals, or microorganisms. One type of bio-based polymer is bio-degradable polymers, which can break down into natural elements over time through biological processes. These polymers are environmentally friendly as they reduce waste accumulation. On the other hand, non-degradable bio-based polymers do not decompose easily and can persist in the environment for long periods. While non-degradable polymers offer durability, they contribute to plastic waste accumulation, impacting ecosystems and posing challenges for waste management.</p></p>

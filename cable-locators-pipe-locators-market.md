<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cable Locators & Pipe Locators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Location</li><li>Passive Location</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cable locators and pipe locators are used in various industries to detect services underground. Active location refers to the use of a transmitter that emits a signal onto a cable or pipe, which can then be traced using a receiver. This method is beneficial when the services are not energized or do not transmit a signal naturally. On the other hand, passive location involves detecting natural signals from the cable or pipe, such as electromagnetic fields or radio frequencies, without the need for a transmitter. This method is suitable when the services are already energized or naturally transmit a signal.</p></p>

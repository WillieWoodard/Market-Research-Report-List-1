<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Wheels and Axles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Railway Wheels</li><li>Railway Axles</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The railway wheels and axles market comprises two main types: railway wheels and railway axles. Railway wheels are circular components that are mounted on the ends of the axles, allowing the train to roll on the tracks. They are made of durable materials like steel and are designed to withstand heavy loads and constant friction. Railway axles, on the other hand, are the rods that connect the wheels to the train's body. They are responsible for transmitting power and supporting the weight of the rolling stock.</p></p>

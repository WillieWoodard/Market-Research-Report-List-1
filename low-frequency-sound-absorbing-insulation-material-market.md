<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Frequency Sound-Absorbing Insulation Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-cell Foams</li><li>Open-cell Foams</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The low-frequency sound-absorbing insulation material market comprises two main types: closed-cell foams and open-cell foams. Closed-cell foams are dense materials that have a compact structure, making them highly effective in blocking low-frequency sound waves. On the other hand, open-cell foams have a more porous structure, allowing sound waves to penetrate and get absorbed. While closed-cell foams provide better sound insulation, open-cell foams offer better sound absorption. Both types have their unique applications in various industries such as construction, automotive, and aerospace.</p></p>

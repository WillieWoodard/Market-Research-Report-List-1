<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Temporary Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Chamber External Temporary Pacemaker</li><li>Single Chamber External Temporary Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The external temporary pacemaker market consists of two main types: dual chamber and single chamber pacemakers. Dual chamber pacemakers have two leads, one in the atrium and one in the ventricle, allowing for more precise control of the heart's electrical activity. Single chamber pacemakers have only one lead, typically placed in the ventricle. Both types are used temporarily to regulate the heart's rhythm in patients experiencing abnormal heart rhythms. These devices are externally worn and can be easily adjusted or removed as needed.</p></p>

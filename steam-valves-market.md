<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Steam Valve</li><li>Electric Steam Valve</li><li>Self-operated Steam Valve</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The steam valve market is divided into three main types: pneumatic steam valves, electric steam valves, and self-operated steam valves. Pneumatic steam valves use air pressure to open and close, offering precise control and reliability. Electric steam valves rely on an electrical signal to control the valve, providing convenience and ease of use. Self-operated steam valves, on the other hand, use the steam pressure itself to regulate the valve position, making them suitable for applications where electricity or compressed air is not available.</p></p>

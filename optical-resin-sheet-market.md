<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Resin Sheet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Material</li><li>Thermoplastic Material</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Optical resin sheets are used in various applications, with two main types being thermosetting and thermoplastic material markets. Thermosetting materials are initially soft and malleable, but through a chemical reaction, they harden irreversibly when exposed to heat or UV light. This property makes them highly durable and resistant to heat and chemicals, making them suitable for applications like lenses and protective coatings. In contrast, thermoplastic materials can be melted and solidified repeatedly without altering their chemical structure. This property allows for easy manipulation and recycling, making them ideal for applications like packaging and flexible displays.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ambulatory Arrhythmia Monitoring Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External</li><li>Implantable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring systems are devices used to detect and monitor irregular heart rhythms in patients. There are two main types of these systems: external and implantable. External monitoring systems involve the use of portable devices attached to the body with electrodes. These devices record and analyze heart rhythms over a period of time. On the other hand, implantable monitoring systems are surgically inserted into the body and constantly monitor heart rhythms. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and managing arrhythmias, ensuring appropriate treatment for patients.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steam-assisted Flare Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Smokeless</li><li>Low Smoke</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Steam-assisted flare systems are used in industries to safely dispose of waste gases through combustion. There are two main types of steam-assisted flare systems: smokeless and low smoke. Smokeless systems use high-pressure steam to mix with the waste gases, resulting in complete combustion and minimal smoke. These systems are commonly used in environmentally sensitive areas. On the other hand, low smoke systems use steam at a lower pressure to reduce smoke emissions, making them suitable for areas with less stringent environmental regulations. Both systems help to mitigate the impact of waste gases on the environment.</p></p>

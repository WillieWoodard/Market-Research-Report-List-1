<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMF Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The CMF (Craniomaxillofacial) Fixation System market is divided into two types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable fixation systems are made from materials that gradually break down in the body over time, eliminating the need for additional removal procedures. They provide temporary stability and are eventually replaced by natural healing processes. Non-absorbable fixation systems, on the other hand, are made from materials that remain in the body permanently and provide long-term stability. They do not degrade over time and are not naturally absorbed by the body.</p></p>
